### Info

this directory contains a replica of [Http Multipart Parser](https://github.com/Http-Multipart-Data-Parser/Http-Multipart-Data-Parser) project by Jake Woods
Versions 2.2.4 was the last version of HttpMultipartParser that supported older .NET platforms such as NET 4.5

taken at some old commit [c0d529c8d0bf5edac1968f70fead75831c283d00](https://github.com/Http-Multipart-Data-Parser/Http-Multipart-Data-Parser/commits/develop?after=e74b52521c34ef96714bacb9c4b9e3e8ee86e847+209&branch=develop)	when the project was	
supporting the now legacy .NET __4.5__ and .NET __4.5.1__
also pruned few unsupported project types to prevent the __no backend for project type installed__ error under SharpDevelop
and converted to x86 plaform for the same reason and from xunit to nunit framework
