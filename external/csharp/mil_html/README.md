### Info

Standalone HTML [parser](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6477/MIL-HTML-Parser)
with no external dependencies - source code from CodeProject article, convered to Visual Studio project, with few cosmetic fixes of conflicting namespaces

The assemly will be used as dependency for [System Tray Selenum 3.x Grid Status Checker](https://github.com/sergueik/powershell_samples/tree/master/csharp/selenium3-grid-status-checker) as alternative to outdated `System.Windows.Forms.WebBrowser.WebBrowser`

### Usage

Note,the original project has `Test` written in VB.Net which is OK for SharpDevelop to compile and run. To render the VB.Net source in designer, will need to open the project in Visual Studio ignoring the `Test` project load message `The application for the project is not installed.`, presumably referring to Nunit.
