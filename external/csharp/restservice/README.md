### Info


[replica os stanalone Rest Service C#](https://github.com/eccosuprastyo/dotnet-csharp/tree/master/restservice)

documented in [](https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/rest-api-csharp-console-application/), including how to 
configure application using using FILE attribute of APPSETTINGS.
### Usage

* configure the system
Without netsh configuration, running the service requires switching to `runas` elevated account and running the command:
```cmd
netsh.exe http delete urlacl url=http://+:9001/
netsh.exe http add urlacl url=http://+:9001/ user=%COMPUTERNAME%\%USERNAME%
```
this will respond with
```sh
URL reservation successfully added
```

NOTE: there is no `/login` url in the `netsh` command since the WCF-style `app.config` is binding the endpoint to the `baseAddress="http://localhost:9001"`


* test `GET` request
```sh
USER=user
PASSWORD=pass
curl -X GET http://localhost:9001/login/$USER/$PASSWORD
```

will return sample JSON:

```json
{
  "Data": {
    "Point": {
      "X":1.2,
      "Y":3.4
    }
  }  
}
```
* test `POST` request
```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:9001/postdata -d "Lorem ipsum dolor sit"
```
will respond with posted data body wrapped in XML:
```xml
<string xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2003/10/Serialization/">Lorem ipsum dolor sit</string>
```
### Work in Progress

Removing `App.config` from the project and replacing with configuation-through-code. This is not finished:

* fixed error  observed after removing the `App.config`:
```text
System.InvalidOperationException: Could not find a base address that matches scheme http for the endpoint with binding WebHttpBinding.
```
* the Appication is behaving as WCF service not REST service:

requesting the page `http://localhost:9001/login/camellabs/camellabs` results in the following:
```text
The message with To 'http://localhost:9001/login/camellabs/camellabs' cannot be processed at the receiver, due to an 
AddressFilter mismatch at the EndpointDispatcher. Check that the sender and receiver's EndpointAddresses agree.
```
