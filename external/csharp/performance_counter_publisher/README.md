### Info

replica of [perfTap](https://github.com/Iristyle/PerfTap) windows service app that publishes windows performance counters to be explored in [Graphite](http://graphite.wikidot.com/) by Ethan J. Brown - rearranged the project structure, converted from VS to SharpDevelop. Noticed the project relies
on another project by same wuthor [nanotube](https://github.com/Iristyle/NanoTube) .NET based client library for publishing metrics to Graphite through a StatsD or StatSite listener for data delivery
and on [nlog](https://github.com/NLog/NLog) for logging [xunit](https://github.com/xunit/xunit) for testing
