# OS CPU & Processor Counters
###############################################################################

# Percentage of elapsed time the processor spends executing non-idle threads
#\Processor(_Total)\% Processor Time
\Processor(*)\% Processor Time

#split between privileged and user
#\Processor(_Total)\% Privileged Time
#\Processor(_Total)\% User Time
\Processor(*)\% Privileged Time
\Processor(*)\% User Time

# Number of threads waiting for CPU cycles, where < 12 per CPU is good/fair, 
#< 8 is better, < 4 is best
\System\Processor Queue Length

#Number of execution contexts switched in the last second, where >6000 is poor, 
#<3000 is good, and <1500 is excellent.
\System\Context Switches/sec

#If context switches/sec suddenly starts increasing however, it may be an 
#indicating of a malfunctioning device, especially if you are seeing a similar 
#jump in the Processor(_Total)\Interrupts/sec counter on your machine. 
#You may also want to check Processor(_Total)\% Privileged Time Counter and see 
#if this counter shows a similar unexplained increase, as this may indicate 
#problems with a device driver that is causing an additional hit on kernel mode 
#processor utilization. In this case you can drill down and maybe find the culprit 
#by examining the Process(instance)\% Processor Time counter for each process 
#instances running on your machine. 
#\Processor(_Total)\Interrupts/sec
#\Processor(*)\Interrupts/sec

#If Processor(_Total)\Interrupts/sec does not correlate well with 
#System\Context Switches/sec however, your sudden jump in context switches may 
#instead mean that your application is hitting its scalability limit on your 
#particular machine and you may need to scale out your application (for example 
#by clustering) or possibly redesign how it handles user mode requests.

# OS Memory & Paging Counters

# Unused physical memory (not page file)
\Memory\Available MBytes

#Reads from hard disk per second to resolve hard pages.
\Memory\Pages Input/sec

#Amount of Page File in use, which indicates the server is substituting disk

\Paging File(*)\% Usage

#Highest %Usage metric since the last time the server was restarted.

#A key measure of disk latency representing the average time, in milliseconds, 
#of each write to disk, where non-cached writes ( > 20 poor, <20 fair, 
#<12 better,  <8 best) differ significantly from cached writes (> 4 poor, 
#<4 fair, <2 better, <1 best ). 
#\PhysicalDisk(_Total)\Avg. Disk sec/Write
\PhysicalDisk(*)\Avg. Disk sec/Write

#A key measure of disk latency representing the average time, in milliseconds, 
#of each read to disk where > 20 is poor, <20 is good/fair, <12 is better, <8 is best
#\PhysicalDisk(_Total)\Avg. Disk sec/Read
\PhysicalDisk(*)\Avg. Disk sec/Read

#The number of bytes sent and received over a specific network adapter, including
# framing characters. Be sure to record the throughput of your SQL Server’s NIC 
#card(s).  Watch for this value possibly exceeding the NIC’s specifications, 
#especially when conducting large and/or multiple backups or copies to network drives.  
#A high-speed network and/or a NIC dedicated to admin processes often alleviates this 
#bottleneck. This counter is a sum of “Network Interface\\Bytes Received/sec” and 
#“Network Interface\\Bytes Sent/sec”.  In some situations, you may wish to determine 
#both inbound and outbound network traffic separately
