# Don't Sleep

## Summary

This application is a simple command line utility that will prevent the computer from going to sleep during those times where you have long running tasks that will fail when the computer enters this state.

## Purpose
I created the application because my Microsoft Surface seems to ignore the power profile settings to prevent it from going into a sleep state. I found when I am uploading/downloading large file sets or I need to do a long running task, like converting a video, the operation would fail. This prevents that problem.

## ChangeLog

Feature: Windows Goodbye gets disabled while running
