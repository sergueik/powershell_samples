Purpose

This library provides an advanced framework for message boxes. 
Some salient features are - 

1. Ability to associate text with buttons, thus you can specify a 
text for each button that tells the user what will happen when the button
is pressed. This is currently shown as a simple tooltip.

2. Ability to specify an option that allows the user to always use the same response
for the specified messagebox.

3. Ability to save/load user preferences for various messageboxes. (Not implemented in this release)

4. Ability to customize buttons, icon, sounds.

5. Ability to specify a Timeout for the message box.

6. Standard button texts are localized based on current culture.
