    Version History: 
        1.3 -
            - Fixes to ShowUI to work under win8
            - Included ConvertTo-ISEAddOn
        1.2
            - Major fixes to Add-UIModule:
               - Add Type whitelist and blacklist (making it easier to add an extra class or two)
               - Support generating one module for multiple assemblies
               - Support pipelining assemblies: ls *.dll | add-uimodule ...
               - Refactor initial run (InstallShowUIAssembly) so that it calls Add-UIModule -- we're using the same code that's in the function.
            - Fix Update-WPFJob so that it sets up all the variables (for control names) the way our event handlers do
            - Add the Module Name to aliases so that name clashes with New-Thing can usually be resolved by using: Thing instead of needing ShowUI\New-Thing
            - Fix Import-UIStyle
            - Add SimpleEditor.ps1 to Examples -- shows menus and commands
            - Add New-UIWidget 
               - Add UIWidgets.ps1 to Examples -- several examples of how to create gadget-style windows
               - Add "Widget" style 
            - Fixed UI Styles that used script blocks in -AsJob
       1.1    
            - Using callstack peeking to create automatic variables for parent function parameters
            - Creates automatic functions for resources containing functions
            - Making UI Styles persistent
            - Initial checkin of Get-Input           
            - Improvements in background data sources (can now handle events on UI thread, easier to launch and manage)
       1.0.1 
            - Patch release
            - Fixing scoping of items inside of the controls Fixes:

            - Fixing code generator to include missing New-CommandBinding and other primitives

            - Added some missing functions from WPK: Get-PowerShellDataSource, Add-GridRow/Add-GridColumn
            - Fixed Get-ChildControl so positional parameters work closer to what they did in WPK
            - Fixed event handler creation so that it does not barf in cases where the event is not in a window (i.e. animation)
            - Significantly improved performance of Set-Property (core function) by avoiding pipelining and by using GetNewClosure rather than recreating script blocks
            - Fixed Get-ChildControl -OnlyDirectChildren to not return the parent control
            -  Fixed error in -AsJob to allow modules stored in non-standard locations to work

                Consolidated all automatically created code into one script block

       0.1.6 -
            - Updating Get-ChildControl to handle content (as it used to)
            - Fixing the way Get-ChildControl handles -PeekIntoNestedControl
            - Updating Show-Window to include event handler cleanup
            - Updating Show-Window to include scriptblock parameter:
                - The scriptblock is run
                - If it produces a visual, that becomes content
                - Otherwise, the result is piped to Out-String
                - Then that becomes the content
                - And the fontfamily attempts to become Consolas (cute fixed width font)

            - Added 'Async' alias for -AsJob in Show-Window for Boots backwards compatibility

            - Completely refactored / fixed Get-ChildControl (now much faster) 
            - Made "XAML input" only happen if the option is turned on (improves perf of Set Property)

            - Removing ErrorActionStop (made phantom UIs more likely)
            - Removing the "extra" handler
            - Switched to generating code from memory, not a file (to avoid potential file locks)

            - Just a little bit more culling 
                (will no longer generate subclasses of [Windows.Media.ImagingBitmapEncoder])
                275 New- commands, versus 676 in WPK and 281 in 0.1.2
       0.1.1 - 
            Changed C# parameter genarator default to avoid ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName 
            (broke the common case of New-Label { "hello" } )
