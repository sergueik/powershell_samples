	<h2>Introduction</h2>
	<div>
		<p>I'm old. Really old. And as a result or age (or maybe just because of bad choices made 
		in my inptemperate youth), my eyesight is beginging to fail me. Everything is out of focus, 
		I can't find quite the right distance at which to hold a book, and if it weren't so annoying, 
		I might find the kaliedoscope color halos that seemingly surround everything somewhat pretty. </p>

		<p>A particular annoyance related to failing eyesight is the infinitesimally small text that 
		Windows uses unless you increase the font size in 10% increments. The problem with this is 
		that even at 110%, the text is WAY bigger than it really needs to be. In any case, this tiny 
		text is used in the WPF MessageBoxe, and it cannot be changed. In fact, NOTHING about the 
		standard WPF messagebox can be changed. This realization finally got the better of me, and 
		I was forced to come up this code.</p>
	</div>

	<h3>But First, Complaints</h3>
	<div>
		When I started researchng the standard WPF MessageBox, I was surprised and appalled that it 
		wasn't a WPF-specific object. It turns out that it's entirely implemented by the 
		Win32.Inetrop functionality, and doesn't have a single drop of WPF goodness thrown in. I 
		suppose a Microsoft apologist could try making a case about how their approach probably 
		reduced the overall .Net code footprint by a few thousand bytes, but I ain't buying it. 
		There was a true opportunity here, and Microsoft squandered it. By the way, this is the 
		reason that it's not configurable in any way - it uses Windows system properties and that's 
		that. You're not allowed to stray from those parameters. BAD PROGRAMMER! BAD! BAD!
	</div>

	<h2>What I Wanted to Achieve</h2>
	<div>
		<p>My primary goal was to develop a replacement for the standard message box that was 
		reasonably configurable, while being totally WPF-based, as well as presenting an interface 
		that was as close as possible to the original message box. Through some <code>static</code> 
		wizardry, I was able to accomplish this without too much heartburn.</p>
	</div>

	<h2>Features</h2>
	<div>
		<h3>Default MessageBox Functionality</h3>
		<div>
			<p>If you don't use any of the static configuration methods, <code>MessageBoxEx</code> 
			behaves and appears pretty much exactly like the standard <code>MessageBox</code> 
			does. This includes the use of icons, system sounds, buttons, and coloration. But 
			that's not why we're here, is it?</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Extended Appearance</h3>
		<div>
			The following standard appearance items can be altered:

			<ul>
				<li>Font<b></b> - This message box can optionally adopt the fonts of the parent 
				application, or even specify the font family and size individually. This was 
				the original reason I came up with the code, but I then decided to take it to 
				new and exciting extremes.<br/><br/></li>

				<li><b>Color</b> - You can optionally specify the foreground and background 
				color of the message itself, as well as the button panel. I leave it as an 
				exercise for the developer to come up with visually please color combinations 
				for his/her own applications.<br/><br/></li>

				<li><b>Button Template</b> - You can optionally specify your own button 
				template so that the message box takes on the same button appearance as your 
				application.<br/><br/></li>

				<li><b>Size</b> - The standard message box can become too big to see the 
				buttons if the message is really long. This implementation limits the max 
				height to the primary work area, so the buttons are always in view. You can 
				also optionally specify the maximum width. The messagebox itself will size 
				itself to the content within the max size constraints. If the message is so 
				large as to make the message box as tall as it's allowed to be, the message 
				becomes vertically scrollable.<br/><br/></li>
			</ul>
		</div>

		<h3>Extended Functionality</h3>

		<p>The following extended functionality is added to the standard MessageBox functionality.</p>

		<ul>
			<li><b>System Sounds</b> - When you specify a system icon (question, error, 
			warning, or information), the default behavior is to also play the assosicate 
			system sound, if one has been associated with that icon in Windows. If you prefer not 
			to hear the system sound, you can use <code>MessageBoxEx.SetAsSilent(true)</code> to 
			suppress the sounds. Most of the time, this would be done when the application starts 
			up, but it can be turned on/off whenever you deem it necessary.<br/><br/></li>

			<li><b>Clickable Error icon</b> - When you display an error message, you can optionally 
			specify what I call an "error delegate" object which allowss the message box to perform 
			some action when the icon is clicked. The is limited to the error icon because that's 
			when you'd most likely want to do something like this. The idea was spurred by a 
			discussion in the CodeProject lounge regarding screen shot generation for emailing to 
			the support team. It ddn't make any sense to me to make this available for any other 
			icon, but it would be easy to change if you need the behaior for the other icons. The 
			code is commented to permit easy modification.<br/><br/></li>

			<li><b>Details</b> - The message box can display both a message, and "details". This 
			could be useful for those times when you want to display an <code>Exception.Message</code>, 
			as well as an <code>Exception.StackTrace</code>, but you don't want to have a huge 
			message box. The details panel is an expander, and is initially collapsed when the 
			message box is displayed.<br/><br/></li>

			<li><b>Checkbox</b> - this displays a Checkbox with a prompt (content) that you 
			specify. Some possible uses for this would be to supress the display of the message 
			box in certain instances, or affect some other functionality in your application. It 
			is up to the developer as fas as handling the checlkbox value. The messagebox does 
			not care beyond presenting itself. See the <code>BtnClickme3c_Click()</code> method 
			in the sample application for an example of how this feature might be used.<br/><br/></li>
		</ul>
	</div>

	<h2>The Code</h2>
	<div>
		<p>The amount of code needed to implement this message box is suprisingly small. So small 
		that it only took me a few hours to implement it, and then move it to a sample project for 
		this article.</p>

		<p>The original version of this article included several code dumps, but with the frequency 
		of change, it became tedious to try to keep them synced up with what's really doing on in 
		the code, so I deleted them from the article. If you want to see what I did, either browse 
		the code here on CodeProject, or just download the code and check it out.</p>

		<h3>Basic Design Goals</h3>
		<div>
			<p>As you know, the standard <code>MessageBox</code> is a static object that doesn't 
			need to be instantiated to use. This new <code>MessageBoxEx</code> is static as well, 
			or at least "static-ish". In order to implement it, I created a standard WPF Window 
			that contains both static and non-static properties and methods. The idea is that the 
			programmer would call the static <code>MessageBox.Show()</code> method, which would 
			then instantiate a non-static version of the window. I also wanted to make the 
			outward-facing experience as identical as possible to the standard 
			<code>MessageBox</code>, so the return values are the same as what you get from the 
			standard message box.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Implementation - XAML</h3>
		<div>
			<p>The xaml for this form is fairly limited because we're not really doing anything fancy. 
			I think the comments in the XAML provide sufficient enough documentation as to not 
			require an accompanying narrative.</p>

			<p><b>Clickable Icon</b> - Since images aren't "clickable", I had to resort to handling 
			the <code>MouseLeftButtonUp</code> event. On top of that, I wanted to make the visual 
			appearance of the icon change when the mouse hovered over it, so I set the default 
			opacity to 0.85, and when the message box is displaying an error, I add a custom style 
			(in the code behind) to the image that reacts to mouse hover, which changes the oacity 
			to 1.0. I also use the code behind to add a tooltip to the image (actually the imiage's 
			parent grid), so the user gets some sort of indication that the icon is indeed clickable.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Implementation - C#</h3>
		<div>
			<p>The code-behind really isn't anything special or technically difficult to understand 
			after a cursory inspection. As stated earlier, the code is essentially broken up into 
			static, and non-static fields, properties, and methods. The message box itself needs to 
			be instantiated, but the class has static properties and methods that can be used for 
			easy configuration and rendering of the message box. Just like <code>MessageBox</code>, 
			<code>MessageBoxEx</code> provides several overloads of the <code>Show()</code> method 
			(and its variants) to display itself.</p>

			<p>As far as code organization is concerned, I did something I don't normally do, but 
			it was done in the interest of making it easy to copy the files into your own code. 
			First, all of the classes related to the <code>MessageBoxEx</code> class are located 
			in the MessageBoxEx.xaml.cs file. Second, I took advantage of the fact that the class 
			is a partial class, and separated the static parts from the non-static parts. It might 
			seem weird, but it helps me, and that's the most important thing.</p>

			<p>To make the form size itself appropriately, I utilized the window <code>SizeToContent</code> 
			property (in the XAML). This property allows the window to grow/shrink to fit its 
			content, allowing the window to only be as big as it needs to be, given the minimum and 
			maximum width/height limitations specified in the XAML. A curious side-effect of the 
			<code>SizeToContent</code> property is that it takes affect AFTER the window has been 
			positioned on the screen. This means that if the window needs to display more than a 
			single line message, the window won't be "centered" on the screen as intended. To 
			mitigate this behavior, I had handle the window's <code>SizeChanged</code> event, and 
			manually re-center the form on the screen. The code was simple enough, but I figuered 
			I'd cite it here.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Useage</h3>
		<div>
			<p>Somewhere in your app startup (I recommend using the constructor in the <code>MainWindow</code> 
			because at that point you can specify the parent window from which to inherit the appropriate 
			font properties (if you want to do that). In the sample app, I created a method called 
			<code>InitMessageBox()</code> containing calls to some of the configuration methods.</p>
			<pre lang="c#">
// this lets the messagebox inherit font properties from the parent
MessageBoxEx.SetParentWindow(this);
// set colors
MessageBoxEx.SetMessageForeground(Colors.White);
MessageBoxEx.SetMessageBackground(Colors.Black);
MessageBoxEx.SetButtonBackground(MessageBoxEx.ColorFromString("#333333"));
// if you have a custome button template (like I do), you can specify it here
MessageBoxEx.SetButtonTemplateName("AefCustomButton");
// set the max form width. Lowest possible value is 300.
MessageBoxEx.SetMaxFormWidth(800);
// 2021.01.03 - silence! No noises from the messagebox
MessageBox.SetAsSilent(true);
			</pre>
			<p>After you've done this once in the application, using <code>MessageBoxEx</code> is 
			identical to using the original <code>MessageBox</code>.</p>
			<pre lang="c#">
MessageBoxResult result = MessageBoxEx.Show("Your message. Continue?", "Caption", MessageBoxButton.YesNoCancel);
			</pre>
			<p>Of course, the button specification defaults to MessageBoxButton.OK if no button 
			group is specified.</p>
			<p>There are a few variants of the <code>Show</code> method that allow you to specify details, a 
			checkbox, or both. Since these actually add functionality to the message box, I 
			figured it would be okay to call them something other than just <code>Show</code>.</p>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h3>The Sample Application</h3>
	<div>
		<img src="MainWindow.jpg" alt="MainWindow" style="margin:5px 0 5px 0;"/><br/>
		<p>The sample application is simple in and of itself, provides a number of buttons that 
		exercise various apects of the <code>MessageBoxEx</code> code. Wherevapplicable, the 
		standard message box is displayed, followed by the extended message boxHere are some 
		screen shots of various combinations of features:</p>
		<ul>
			<li><b>A very short 1-line message with the OK button.  
			<code>MessageBoxButton.YesNoCancel</code> buttons. Displays the <code>MessageBoxImage.Asterisk</code> icon/sound.<br/>
			<img src="ClickMe_1.jpg" alt="Small message" style="margin:5px 0 5px 0;" />
			<br/></li>
			<li><b>A message that's long enough to make the window the widest it can be, and wrap 
			the message text, displays the OK button, and plays the "error" icon/sound.<br/>
			<img src="ClickMe_2.jpg" alt="Medium message" style="margin:5px 0 5px 0;" />
			<br/></li>
			<li><b>Click Me (info)</b> - displays a message that's long enough to cause the window to 
			be the widest/tallest it can be, and force the vertical scrollbar to be enabled. Displays the info icon/sound.<br/>
			<img src="../Screenshots/ClickMe_3.jpg" alt="Huge message" style="margin:5px 0 5px 0;" />
			<br/></li>
			<li><b>Click Me (question)</b> - displays a message that's long enough to make the window the 
			widest it can be, and wrap the message text. Displays thequestion icon/sound.<br/>
			<img src="../Screenshots/ClickMe_3.jpg" alt="Huge message" style="margin:5px 0 5px 0;" />
			<br/></li>
			<li><b>Click Me (info/details)</b> - displays the specified message, and includes a "Details" 
			area that, when expanded, displays the specified detail text in a scrolling <code>TextBox</code>. 
			It also displays the info icon/sound.<br/>
			<img src="../Screenshots/ClickMe_5.jpg" alt="Huge message" style="margin:5px 0 5px 0;" />
			<br/></li>
		</ul>

		<p>If you don't hear a sound, it's because you haven't specified an associated system sound in 
		Windows. This will most likely happen on the "question" button (that's where it happened to me, 
		and setting a sound caused both the standard message box and the extended oine to play the 
		appropriate sound).</p>
	</div>

	<h2>History</h2>
	<div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>2021.01.09</b> - Made the following changes:<br/>
			<span>- The error icon (if displayed) can be made clickable, and can trigger an action 
				defined by the developer, such as sending the message text (and details if 
				spcified).</span><br/>
			<span>- A new set <code>Show...</code> overloads that allows the developer to 
				specify amplifying detail text in the message box</span><br/>
			<span>- The ability to present a "Do not show this message again" checkbox that will 
				disallow the display of the message box.</span><br/>
			<br/></li>

			<li><b>2021.01.04</b> - Made the MessageBoxIcon allignment the same as the standard 
			MessageBox. I also took a stab at fixing the ssue that caused the message box to be 
			replaced as the top-most window of an application. Finally, I updated the screen shots 
			and included screen shots from the standard MessageBox for a more immediate visual 
			comparison within the article. Once again, I did NOT update the source code displayed 
			in the article, but there is a new ZIP file download.<br/><br/></li>

			<li><b>2021.01.03</b> - Added support for <code>MessageBoxIcon</code> and system sounds, 
			changed to using a TextBox for the message display so you can copy the message to the 
			clipboard, and changed some control alignment to make it "better".
			<br/><br/></li>
			<li><b>2020.12.26</b> - Initial publication<br/><br/></li>
		</ul>
