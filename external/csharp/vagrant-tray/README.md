# VagrantTray
VagrantTray is a small application written in C# with WPF to control Vagrant instances on a Windows machine

# About This Project
I started this project after I discovered a need to be able to easily control my Vagrant machines. At the time I was learning .net with C# for University and figured I'd have a go.

Now this code will not be great, it wont be the most efficent, it may not even be the correct way to do things, but I started this project with no WPF knowledge and just ran with it, and as a bonus it works well!
