Swami Sivananda - Easy steps to Yoga

Get up at 4 a.m. daily. This is Brahmamuhurta which is extremely favourable for meditation
on God. 

From food comes juice or chyle, from chyle blood, from blood flesh, from flesh fat, from
fat bones, from bones marrow and lastly from marrow semen. Semen is the quintessence of
food or blood. One drop of semen is manufactured out of 40 drops of blood according to the
medical science. According to Ayurveda it is elaborated out of 80 drops of blood. Just as
sugar is all-pervading in the sugar-cane, butter in milk, so also semen is pervading the
whole body. Just as the butter-milk is thin after butter is removed, so also semen is
thinned by its wastage. The more the wastage of semen the more is the weakness.
In Yoga Sastras it is said: falling of semen brings death; preservation of semen gives life.
Semen is the real vitality in man. It is the hidden treasure for man. It imparts
Brahma-Tejas to the face and strength to the intellect. 

Scriptures declare emphatically: By the practice of Brahmacharya, longevity, glory,
strength, vigour, knowledge, wealth, undying fame, virtues and devotion to Truth increase.

Bhartrihari says: For food, I have what begging brings and that too tasteless and once a
day; for bed, the earth; and for attendant, the body itself; for dress, I have worn out
blanket made up of hundred patches; still alas! lust does not leave me.

It is easy to tame a wild tiger or a lion or an elephant. It is easy to play with the cobra.
It is easy to walk over the fire. It is easy to devour fire and drink the waters of ocean.
It is easy to uproot the Himalayas. It is easy to get victory in the battlefield. But it is
difficult to eradicate lust. 

Have cold hip bath. Get up at 4 a.m.

Through the Grace of God, I am becoming purer and purer every day,
in every way.
Pleasures come but not to stay.
Mortal flesh is only clay.
Everything will pass away.
Brahmacharya is the only way.

Sensuality destroys life, lustre, strength, vitality, memory, wealth, great fame, holiness
and devotion to the Supreme.

Why not investigate the very idea of body? Does the mind appear in the body or the body in the mind? Surely
there must be a mind to conceive the "I-am-the-body" idea. A body without a mind cannot be 'my body'.
'My body' is invariably absent when the mind is in abeyance. It is also absent when the mind is deeply
engaged in thoughts and feelings. (434)
