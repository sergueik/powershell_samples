### Info

Copy of the [detect what .NET Framework versions](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/17501/Using-managed-code-to-detect-what-NET-Framework-ve) code, too old so to inventory the __4.5__... __4.8__ versions

### Usage

on some __Windows 8.1__ machines it was observed to be impossible to install .Net Framework __4.8__ with obscure error message:

```text
Exe (C:\e9c5f49144e0267cce79\x64-Windows8.1-KB4486105-x64.cab) failed with 0x1a90 - The function attempted to use a name that is reserved for use by another transaction. .
Exe Log File: CBS.log
Final Result: Installation failed with error code: (0x00001A90), "The function attempted to use a name that is reserved for use by another transaction. " (Elapsed time: 0 00:04:57).
