To build, open the solution file in Visual Studio.
There is no x64 configuration defined but it has been built succesfully for x64.  NOTE:  You can run the 32 bit build on 64 bit Windows versions.

MANUAL INSTALL:
	0. Please note you must complete this steps with elevated privileges on Windows Vista or Later.  One way to do this is to right click on cmd.exe and select "run as administrator".
	1. Copy hsflowd.exe to a suitable location.  %WINDIR%\system32 might be a good choice.  
	2. Configure hsflowd as a Windows Service: `sc create hsflowd type= own start= auto error= normal binPath= path\to\hsflowd.exe DisplayName= "Host sFlow Agent"`
	3. Configure the sFlow collector: `reg ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\hsflowd\Parameters /v collector /d name.or.ip.of.collector
	3. [Optional] Configure the sFlow port: `reg ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\hsflowd\Parameters /v port /t REG_DWORD /d 6343
	3. [Optional] Configure the pollingInterval: `reg ADD HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\hsflowd\Parameters /v pollingInterval /t REG_DWORD /d 30

Debug:
	hfslowd is implemented as a Windows service, but it can also be invoked from the command line.  When invoked from the command line hsflowd is in debug mode and will output error and information to stderr. In order to run from the command line the service must already be installed per the instructions above.

Supported Windows versions:
	hsflowd for WindowsXP is known to run on:
		Windows XP
		Windows XP x64
		Windows Server 2003 x64
	It should run unchanged on:
		Windows Vista
		Windows Vista x64
		Windows 7
		Windows 7 x64
		Windows Server 2003
		Windows Server 2008
		Windows Server 2008 x64
	However for newer platforms, please use the newer hsflowd for Windows,  rather than this "WindowsXP" port.
